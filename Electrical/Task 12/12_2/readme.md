# Task 12_2 â€” Transformation Class (Homogeneous & Quaternion) ðŸ”„ðŸ§®  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

This task made me realize the importance of having a **solid math foundation** ðŸ“š.  
Before diving in, I spent time researching key concepts (see `research/` folder) to ensure I understood the underlying theory.  

Using my **OOP knowledge**, I built a **Transformation Class** with two approaches:  

1. **Homogeneous Transformation**  
2. **Quaternion-based Transformation**  

The class also includes a method to decide **which transformation approach to use**.  
- Using **quaternions all the time** would increase computation cost.  
- By switching intelligently, the class became more **efficient and practical** âš¡.

## âœ¨ Key Takeaways  

- **Math is crucial** â†’ strong foundations make implementation smoother.  
- **Quaternions** prevent gimbal lock (e.g., when pitch = 90Â° about Y-axis).  
- Smarter design choices â†’ better efficiency without overcomplicating.  
- **Visualization** really clarified the difference between **local vs global frames**.
