# Task 10 — AI Basics 🤖📊  

By this stage, I had already completed **AI Phase 1**, but this task served as a valuable refresher and gave me space to strengthen core concepts.

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
- **Pandas Refresher** → reinforced skills in cleaning and preparing datasets efficiently.  
- **GPU-based tuning** → practiced optimizing training performance using GPU acceleration.  
- **Logistic Regression** → revisited and tested its effectiveness on different tasks.  
- **KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)** →  
  - Small *k* → high risk of overfitting 🔴  
  - Logistic Regression generally more stable on small datasets ⚖️  
- **Dataset Size Matters** → both methods required larger datasets for reliable evaluation and efficient performance making me see on real life the theoretical problems i know came along small datasets
