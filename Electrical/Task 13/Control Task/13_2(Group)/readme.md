# Task 13_2 — Motor Selection ⚡🔩  

---

## 📌 Reflection  

Motor selection isn’t my strongest area, so I didn’t directly participate in this task.  
However, I carefully reviewed the provided files and now understand **why specific motors were chosen**.  

This made me realize the importance of:  
- ⚙️ **Choosing components wisely** to meet system requirements.  
- 💰 **Balancing technical performance with economic efficiency**.  

I’ll make sure to strengthen my knowledge in this field, since **picking the right components is essential** for designing reliable and cost-effective systems.
