# Task 5_1 : Communication Protocols (I2C, UART, SPI)

In this task, I explored different **communication protocols** used between devices and microcontrollers, including **IÂ²C, UART, and SPI** ðŸ”Œ.  

### Key Learnings
- Understood the basics of **IÂ²C, UART, and SPI** communication protocols.  
- Learned how microcontrollers can act as **masters** or **slaves** depending on the setup.  
- Gained introductory knowledge on how communication protocols enable multiple devices to share data efficiently.  

### Implementation
- Focused on the **IÂ²C protocol** ðŸ“¡.  
- Connected **three Arduinos**:  
  - **1 Master Arduino** ðŸ§   
  - **2 Slave Arduinos** ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–  
- Each slave Arduino gathered sensor readings and sent them back to the master.  
- The master averaged the readings to produce a final result.  

### Outcome
- Built a working **multi-Arduino IÂ²C network**.  
- Established the foundation for later concepts like **sensor fusion** ðŸ”„.
