# Task X: PCB Design for Dual Power Supply (5V & 3.3V)

This task introduced me to **PCB design using Altium Designer** üñ•Ô∏è. It was my first time working with the tool, and I gained hands-on experience in schematic capture, footprint management, and 3D modeling.  

The designed PCB provides **two regulated outputs**:  
- ‚ö° **5 V @ 1 A**  
- ‚ö° **3.3 V @ 0.8 A**

### Key Learnings
- Learned how to download and assign footprints, as well as create custom schematic symbols and 3D models.  
- Understood how **trace length and width** affect inductance and current handling.  
- Discovered why **capacitors should be placed close** to the components they regulate.  
- Explored methods of current control, including ICs, PWM limiting, and variable resistors.  

### Design Features
- **Voltage Regulators**: 5 V and 3.3 V outputs.  
- **Terminal Blocks**: Rosetta connectors for easy wiring.  
- **LED Indicators** üí°: Show status of each regulated output.  
- **Capacitors**: Selected and placed according to datasheets for stable operation.  

### Outcome
- Designed a **functional dual-output PCB**.  
- Built a solid foundation in **Altium Designer** for future PCB projects.
