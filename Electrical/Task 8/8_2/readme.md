# Task 8:2 — OOP & Docker 🖥️🐳  

In this task, I focused on two main areas:  
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++**  
2. **Docker fundamentals**  

---

## 👥Key Learnings  
- Gained **initial knowledge of OOP in C++** (syntax & structure) and compared it with **Python’s OOP model** 🐍.  
- Learned what **Docker** is and how to create a **Docker image** to run code in different environments.  

---

## 🚀 Highlights  

### 🔹 OOP in C++ vs Python  
- Understood **C++ class syntax**, constructors, and access specifiers.  
- Compared with Python’s dynamic and simpler OOP structure.  
- First step into writing structured, reusable code in C++.  

### 🔹 Docker Basics 🐳  
- Created a **Docker image** to package code for consistent execution.  
- Understood **containers vs virtual machines**:  
  - Docker uses **OS-level virtualization** (shares kernel).  
  - Virtual Machines emulate full OS → heavier & slower.  
- Learned why Docker is preferred for lightweight and reproducible deployments.
