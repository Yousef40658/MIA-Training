# Task X: Introduction to STM32 Blue Pill (LED & Buzzer Control)

This task gave me an introduction to the **STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller** and how to program it using **STM32CubeIDE** 🖥️.  

### Key Learnings
- Gained first experience writing code for STM32.  
- Understood how to configure and use **interrupt pins**.  
- Learned how to reset system functionality through external input.  

### Implementation
- Controlled **multiple LEDs** 💡 and a **buzzer** 🔊 using STM32.  
- Used **interrupt pins** to trigger actions.  
- Added a **reset button** 🔁 to return all functionalities to their initial state.  

### Outcome
- Successfully wrote and deployed STM32 code for LED and buzzer control.  
- Built a solid foundation for future work with **STM32 microcontrollers** ⚡.
