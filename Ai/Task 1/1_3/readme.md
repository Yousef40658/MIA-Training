in this task i've deepened my knowledge in USING oop specially in inherteince and gained initial knowledge in how to give voice commands allowing for infint number of ideas in the futre 

Got it 👍
Here’s a copy-ready README.md version you can paste directly:

# Racing Duel Simulator

This project is a **turn-based racing duel simulator** where two drivers — **Verstappen** and **Mostafa** — battle using offensive and defensive maneuvers to reduce each other’s tire health while managing their fuel.

The game supports two modes:
- **Automatic mode**: AI chooses moves randomly.
- **Manual mode**: Players select moves via **voice commands** using speech recognition.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition


Run the game:

python your_script.py

🏁 Gameplay Overview

Each turn, one driver attacks while the other defends.

Attacks reduce the opponent’s tire health based on fuel cost and defense effectiveness.

The match ends when:

A driver’s tire health reaches zero, or

Both players run out of fuel (draw condition).

🥇 Winning Conditions

A driver wins by reducing the opponent’s tire health to 0.

If both players run out of fuel but still have tire health, the winner is determined by who has more remaining health.

If health values are close, the game declares a draw.


Do you want me to also make a **shorter lightweight version** (only gameplay + run instructions), or keep it full like above?
